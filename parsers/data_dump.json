        "description": "Modern portfolio theory started with Harry Markowitz's 1952 seminal paper \"Portfolio Selection.\" He put forth the idea that risk-adverse investors should optimize their portfolio based on a combination of two objectives: expected return and risk. Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming.",

An accurate daily weather forecast in the modern era relies not only on our intellectual understanding of the atmosphere, but also on the real-time monitoring and numerical modelling of atmospheric motions. Both of them are fruitful applications of atmospheric physics. In recent decades, there has been growing concern over human impacts on global climate. The wide-ranging claims of human-induced climate change have to be supported by scientific theories and evidence. Atmosphere physics plays a central role in such debates as the atmosphere is a core component of the climate system. This course offers both conceptual and quantitative discussions of the fundamental physical processes that shape our weather and climate.",

This course provides an introduction to the physical principles of climate model as well as all procedures related to climate modeling. Some classes will be taught in the computer laboratory, where students will perform their own simulations using web-based climate model and analyze the results. In addition, this course explores the challenge of understanding and managing the risks of climate extremes.",

This is a project-based course to develop the students' knowledge/experience in designing and building a practical mechatronics system (formerly called Industrial Training). Students will work in teams to identify the needs for their designed prototype. Also, students will be given the opportunity to design and build various mechatronics components including electronic circuits, motors, sensors, etc. from CAD drawings, and practise their engineering knowledge through all laboratory sessions. The main goal is to develop and nurture skills in problem-solving, communication, interpersonal interaction, project and time management, etc. via the entire project.",

Nowadays modular forms are an indispensable tool in modern number theory and they also have important applications in geometry and mathematical physics. Topics covered in this course include: the modular group and congruence subgroups, definition of modular forms and first properties, Eisenstein series, theta series, Peterson inner product, Hecke operators, L-functions, modular curves, modularity. In the final lecture(s) we will discuss the basics about automorphic forms, which are generalization of modular forms to higher rank groups.

The interface dynamics are captured by the evolution of the scalar function in an Eulerian framework. The main advantages of capturing methods are (1) a geometric problem is turned into a partial differential equation problem on a fixed grid with simple data structure, (2) topological changes, such as merging or splitting, can be handled easily in the viscosity sense.

        "description": "The rapid economic modernization and building of a modern state in Japan after the Meiji Restoration of 1868 has long been considered a typical case of successful economic and political development. Japan's success has been overwhelmingly attributed to its \"learning from the west\". The lack of appreciation of Japan's indigenous resources of economic and political development achieved before the coming of Westerners leads to a western-centered view of development. This course aims to place Japan's development after 1868 against the historical background of economic and political development in Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868). Against this historical background, it emphasizes multiple possibilities in the political development of Japan after the Meiji Restoration, foreign aggression was by no means the only path of Japan's political development. Japan's indigenous development of market economy, state-building, and local representative assemblies contribute significantly to Japan's rapid rise as a regional power in 1905 and a world power after 1918. This course will deepen students' knowledge of modern Japan, provide them with the analytic skill and critical thinking over the issue of Japan's political and economic modernization. By highlighting the parallel processes of military development and the development of democracy in Japan between 1895 and 1931, this course will help the students to have a better understanding of the rise and collapse of democracy in pre-Japan. This course will help the students to view the relationship between Japan and China from a historical perspective.",

Often political concepts such as state, democracy, dictatorship, repression and protest, representation, and election, are considered too abstract or too complicated. Addressing those concepts through movies will allow students to understand those concepts with living examples and empathy. The course explores important political topics and themes including political power and election, democracy, protest and repression, media, corruption, and war.

        "description": "This course explores the statistical methods used for causal inference in the social sciences. Working within the potential outcomes framework, we discuss how the logic of inference for randomized experiments is the same as for non-randomized (observational) studies under certain additional assumptions. Though randomized experiments serve as the gold standard for causal inference, we note how it may sometimes be reasonable to treat non-experimental data as if it had been drawn from an experiment. Usually, this involves some knowledge about how the natural world produced the data through a quasi-random process. Research designs and methods covered include randomized experiments, matching, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, synthetic control, and regression discontinuity designs. In turn, we discuss how all of these methods require a unique set of assumptions to allow us to make valid casual inferences. Throughout the course we will draw examples from across the social sciences to illustrate the vast range of applications of these methods. Furthermore, the course will include computing sessions during which students are taught how to implement the techniques using modern statistical software.",

The changing images of women on screen went hand in hand with major cinematic movements in history, including the left turn in the 1930s, the rise of animation, socialist filmmaking, model opera film, underground/independent filmmaking, and the cinematic globalization.

In this course, we engage these questions by putting examples in Chinese literature and culture from the past and the present into dialogue. Taking a transmedia approach, this course brings in both textual and visual materials from history, literature, and cinema. By juxtaposing materials of relevance from different times and carried by various media, we explore continuities and discontinuities in Chinese culture as well as the possibilities and limits each historical moment offers for cultural transformation.",

Students will investigate how language is used by migrants in areas including health, education, the law and employment. They will explore how language practices are shaped by face-to-face and mediated encounters and by the constraints of political and institutional contexts.

In the context of this course, \"technologies\" should be understood as the operations and cooperation of politics, ethics, and religions through which passions for the self and other is formed and expressed. Together, the class investigate the literary transformations and ramifications of two perennial themes - love and the self - in Chinese literature across temporal and generic boundaries. How is \"selfhood\" philosophized, lyricized, and narrated? How is \"love\" represented, assessed, and contested? We examine how one's understanding of subjectivity, imagination of gender and sexuality, and knowledge of historical changes are mediated through diverse \"technologies\" in which explorations of the self and articulations of romantic engagement intertwine.",

Distanced from the state-controlled film industry and often regarded as a counter culture against mainstream ideologies, independent cinema is frequently banned in China and screened abroad at international film festivals. As a symbol of both media democracy and secrecy, it provides us with a unique window to understand the diversified culture and society full of clamorous voices in post-1989 China. This course explores the histories, aesthetics, styles, contents, techniques, and technologies of independent cinema in contemporary China. It will be students-oriented and conducted through forms of seminars and discussions. Unlike traditional courses that are based on uni-directional lectures, readings, exams, and papers in a fixed classroom, this experimental course encourages students to venture outside and engage more with our society.

In the past, Southwest China, particularly Yunnan, has been conceptualised as an area both remote from the Chinese political centre and isolated from the outside world, but an analysis of historical data concerning the formation of kingdoms and polities, trade routes, and the movement of people offers a different interpretation. It demonstrates that far from being isolated, the two areas overlap, and in reality are bonded by political, cultural and ethnic ties. Analysis of historical data provides a vibrant perspective for understanding Southwest China, not as an area at the margins of Chinese and SEA history, but as a vital link in a chain that connects SEA with the worlds of China and Tibet. Emphasis on interconnection highlights a fundamental relationship between both regions, and offers students a framework for understanding the increased presence of China in mainland SEA in recent years.",

Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming.",
